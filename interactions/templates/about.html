<h1>About HISE</h1>

<p>
    <b>H</b>ematopoiesis <b>I</b>ntercellular <b>S</b>ignaling <b>E</b>xplorer (HISE) is a database tool for exploration of intercellular communication
    patterns of hematopoietic stem cells in the mouse bone marrow at the single cell level. To start exploring, 
    we provide four starting points: <b>Bone Marrow Cell Types</b>, <b>Signaling Pathways</b>, <b>Pathway Correlations</b>, and <b>Genes</b>.
</p>

<h3>Selecting an HSPC</h3>
    <p>On the Cell Types, Pathways, and Pathway Correlation pages, you will be met with a menu on the left hand side 
        prompting you to "Select HSPC Type". Selecting an HSPC will reload the page to display interaction data using 
        the selected cell (interacting %, intensity, pathway correlations, etc.).

        <p>
            Cell types are split into three categories: non-hematopoietic, blood
            and immune, and HPCs. Selecting a cell type from the dropdown menu takes you to a page 
            that displays the details of that cell type. These details include: the pathways 
            the given cell type is involved in with the selected HSPC (left menu), and a plot to visualize the pathways, 
            fraction of single cells and interaction scores for the given pathway.

        <p>
            Like cell types, pathways are split into three categories: secreted signaling, cell-cell contact, 
            and ECM-Receptor. Selecting a pathway from the dropdown menu takes you to a page 
            that displays the details of that pathway. These details include: the pathway's 
            ligands and receptors, the cell types that participate in the pathway with selected HSPC, 
            and a plot to visualize the fraction of single cells and interaction scores for  
            the given pathway. This page also links relevant information regarding the pathway and evidence of 
            its ligand-receptor pairs under "Details on the ___ pathway".

            <a class="titleLink" href="{% url 'correlations' %}">Pathway Correlations</a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Spearman rank correlations at the single cell level were calcualted across all cell type-pathway pairs (i.e. T-cells Receiving MHC-I).
            Correlations were filtered such that pathways in a pair shared no functional genes.
            They were then filtered such that their adjusted p-value < 0.05. These correlations were then collapsed to pathway level correlations by 
            averaging their cell type-pathway pair correlations and taking the best adjusted p-value. Note that because correlations were calculated 
            at the cell-type-pathway level and combined after being sorted into positive and negative correlations, it is possible that the same 
            intercellular signaling pathway correlation can be both negative and positive (see VCAM and PARs for an example). This is because Pathway 
            A and Pathway B may be positively correlated for cell types X,Y, and Z but negatively correlated for cell types Q,R, and S.

            Genes are split into two groups, <b>ligands</b> and <b>receptors</b>. Selecting a gene 
            from the dropdown menu takes you to a page that displays the details of the gene. These 
            details include: the corresponding ligand or receptor, the pathways it is included in, 
            a link to literature reference supporting the ligand-receptor pair and pathway, 
            and a link to the corresponding Gene Expression Commons information page (<a href="https://gexc.riken.jp/models/3/genes" target="_blank">Gene Expression Commons</a>).
